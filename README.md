minishell
Overview

minishell is a simple shell implementation that provides basic command execution functionalities across macOS, Linux, and Windows platforms. It uses the readline library for input handling and system calls like execve, fork, and dup for process management.
Features

    Command execution using execve
    Process creation with fork
    Input and output redirection with dup
    Support for basic shell features, including:
        Command parsing
        Built-in commands (e.g., cd, exit)

Requirements

Compile the project: Replace the Path in the Makefile for your custume path of readline:

bash

    gcc -o minishell yoursourcefile.c -lreadline -L /Users/yourusername/goinfre/yourusername/.brew/opt/readline/lib -I /Users/yourusername/goinfre/yourusername/.brew/opt/readline/include

Windows

    Install necessary tools:
        Use a compatible C/C++ compiler (like MinGW or Microsoft Visual Studio).
